#Contributer: Aakash Dinkar

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Discription

When the page opens up, a simple form will appear which is designed to take input audio file from the user.
After the user chooses a file from his local storage, the user is needed to click on the upload button.

After the upload button is clicked, the page redirects, now the screen shows the user an audio player,
The audio player will play the selected audio file, the user uploaded, on click on "Play button" in the audio player.

The audio player have button to perform some functions like, play, pause, skip 5 seconds forward, go 5 seconds backward etc.,
and a volume option to adjust the volume of the audio player.

The audio player have a seekbar which shows the current progress of the audio track,
the seekbar is also adjustable i.e, you can jump to another time in the audio by adjusting the position of seekbar thumb.
Once the audio has been played to the end, the player stops.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
